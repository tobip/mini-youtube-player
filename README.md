# Mini Youtube Player
> Search and play videos on youtube in cli

Main features:
* Search for Videos or Playlists on youtube
* View the search results
* Play a Video or only listen to audio
* View a history of recently played videos

That's it. Miniyoutubeplayer is not intended to have many features.
Instead it is intended to be simple and just work. (hopefully)

Mini-Youtube-Player uses youtube-search-python from https://github.com/alexmercerind/youtube-search-python -- thanks for the great work!!

Have fun.
